# Goal 
This is a naive attempt at implementing Action Recogintion using ActionS-ST-VLAD from the paper [https://cse.buffalo.edu/~jsyuan/papers/2019/Action-Stage_Emphasized_Spatiotemporal_VLAD_for_Video_Action_Recognition.pdf].  I was not able to correctly implement everything.  There appears to be something wrong during the sampling stage which prevented me from moving to the encoding step (ST-VLAD).
